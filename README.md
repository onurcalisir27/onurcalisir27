Hi, hello, my name is Onur (I pronounce it Honor). I am a graduate student pursuing his MS in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University with a concentration in Robotics and Control Systems. I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey, but I've completed my undergraduate studies at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2024. 

 I am working to become a Robotics Software Engineer. I am passionate about Autonomous Systems, Learning Controllers, and all things robotics! I am experienced in programming in C++, Python, ROS, and MATLAB; educated in machine learning algorithms, optimization methods, and learning based models.

 Alonside my software skills, I am also experienced in CAD software(OnShape, SolidWorks, AutoCAD), 3D Printing and Rapid Prototyping, and Electronics/Mechatronics. 
  
For my research project I have combined my software and hardware skills to build an autonomous rover, starting from the CADing and wiring of the components to writing ROS code to control my robot to autonomously navigate using adaptive controllers!
