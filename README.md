## About Me
Hi, hello, I'm Onur (pronounced Honor). I am a graduate student pursuing his MS in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University with a concentration in Robotics and Control Systems. 

 I am currently working to become a Robotics Software Engineer. I am passionate about Autonomous Systems, Learning Controllers, and all things robotics! I am experienced in programming in C++, Python, ROS, and MATLAB; knowledgable in machine learning algorithms, optimization methods, and robot learning. Alonside my software skills, I'm experienced at CAD softwares (OnShape and SolidWorks), as well as Rapid Prototyping, Electronics, and Mechatronics. 
  
For my research project I am combining my software and hardware skills to build an autonomous rover from scratch; starting from the CAD and wiring of the hardware components to programming in ROS for the control of my autonomous robot using custom adaptive controllers! Read more about it under my repository "LearningAdaptive.git"
